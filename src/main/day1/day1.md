# Day 1
## [Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
In a list of numbers, we have to find the couple that sum to 2020 and  multiply them.
```text
1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc
```

Each line contains the `password policy` and the `password`.

Our task is to check that the couple :
